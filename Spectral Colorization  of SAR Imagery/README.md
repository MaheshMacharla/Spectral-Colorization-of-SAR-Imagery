# SAR-Image-Colorization

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging is a remote sensing technology that captures high-resolution images by using radar data, making it effective in various conditions, including cloud cover and night. Unlike optical images, which contain natural color information, SAR images are monochromatic, presenting significant interpretative challenges. However, SAR images have extensive applications across environmental monitoring, geology, disaster assessment, and urban planning due to their capacity to reveal structural details. The absence of color, however, can hinder the interpretability of these images, particularly for visual analysts accustomed to RGB imagery. This project seeks to bridge this gap by developing a deep learning model to colorize SAR images, using paired SAR and optical images as a training dataset.
